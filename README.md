# tasks-and-solutions
I collected a number of popular tasks that are asked at interviews and solved them.

_If you know the solution better than mine, do not be angry, because I solved the puzzles myself, and their solutions are the first thing that came to my mind_

- [anagram](src/solutions/anagram.ts)
- [debounce](src/solutions/debounce.ts)
- [delay](src/solutions/delay.ts)
- [fibonacci](src/solutions/fibonacci.ts)
- [palindrome](src/solutions/palindrome.ts)
- [sum](src/solutions/sum.ts)
- [unique](src/solutions/unique.ts)
- [flatten](src/solutions/flatten.ts)
